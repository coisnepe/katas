A tiny template for pure ruby projects such as practicing code katas.
Setup with [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard).
Specs and rubocop may be run continuously by running `guard`, or once by running `rspec`!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/coisnepe/ruby_rspec_template.git
$ cd ruby_rspec_template
$ bundle install
$ guard
```
